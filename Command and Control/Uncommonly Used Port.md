Technique Description: Uncommonly Used Port (T1065)
------------------------------------
Attackers may use uncommon ports to bypass firewalls or other access controls to establish their C2 channel.

Assumptions 
-------------
We assume that the attacker has access to the system already and is using an uncommon port from within to reach out to C2.

Execution 
-------------
test-netconnection -ComputerName #{google.com} -port #{8081}
