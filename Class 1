Technique Description: Rundll32.exe 
------------------------------------
Rundll32.exe is a Windows program that allows for execution of binaries. This can be used by attackers as a defense evasion tactic as well as an execution tactic because it can be used as a proxy to run their malicious code since the process may not be monitored due to false positives.  

Assumptions 

 Execution (test script used) 

 Detection 

    Visibility 

A binary run through rundll32.exe will generate an Event ID 1 on Windows 7 through Sysmon operational logs as Process Create. When the script or binary is finished execution it will trigger EventID 5 Process Termination.  

    Filter/ Correlation Rule 

EventID=1 AND cmdline=”rundll32.exe”

    Scripting 

Technical Description: Attackers can use scripts to assist and create actions that could possibly done manually. Scripting allows for the attacks to be run faster which enables them to be able to gain access to the victim faster. Scripting can also bypass process monitoring devices by working with the operating system at the API level.

    AppInit DLLS 
-------------------------------------
Technical Description: DLLS specified in AppInit DLL values which are in the registry keys. The keys are run by user32.dll.  

Assumptions 

 Execution (test script used) 

From cmd line: reg import handler.reg 

 Detection: monitor DDL that are loaded by user32.dll and look for abnormal DLLs that are loaded into process. We can also monitor AppInit_DLLs registry for any changes that aren’t correlated with software.
